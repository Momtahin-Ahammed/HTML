    <h1 style="font-size: medium; color: black;font-family: 'Times New Roman';">Histpry of Bangla language</h1>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">History Bangla emerged as a new Indo-Aryan language by 900-1000 AD through Magadhi apabhramsh and abahattha, two stages of Magadhi prakrit (600 BC - 600 AD), along with two other Indo-Aryan languages, Oriya and Assamese.
     Until the 14th century, there was little linguistic difference between Bangla and Assamese.The evolution of Bangla may be divided into three historical phases: Old Bangla (900/1000-1350), Medieval Bangla (1350-1800) and Modern Bangla (1800-). 
     The earliest example of old Bangla is to be found in the poems of the charyapada, though the language of these poems is also related to eastern Magadhi languages. Shrikrsnakirtan or Shrikrsnasandarbha of baru chandidas is an example of the early form of medieval Bangla. 
     Other writings in medieval Bangla are the translations of the ramayana and the mahabharata, Vaishnava lyrics, poetical biographies of chaitanya, various forms of the mabgalkavya, narrative poetry written at the court of Arakan and Rosang, Shakta Poetry and purbababga-gitika. 
     An influx of Perso-Arabic words into the language took place at this point of evolution. Bangla also borrowed from sanskrit, the words known as tatsama and tadbhava, English and other languages in the modern Bangla phase.</p>
